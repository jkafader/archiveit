=====================================
Installing This Wireframe from Source
=====================================

Get the source
==============

Create a working directory for the source
-----------------------------------------

Create and cd to a nice spot to check it out the code::

    cd ~/my_projects/AI5_wireframe/

(Of course, switch out "my_projects" with whatever you call your main source directory,
and "AI5_wireframe" with whatever you want the root of the source tree for this wireframe
to be called)

Then clone the repo from github::

    git clone https://github.com/jkafader/archiveit.git

Install Python 3.3
==================

https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-335/

I downloaded the python 3.3.5 installer dmg. Run through the steps for the installer, 
then locate the python3 executable it installed.

Install Virtualenv for Python3.3
================================

pip3 install virtualenv

Link Python 3 into the virtualenv
=================================
